# ARTPoS-data

This repo collects the data presented in papers
"Adaptive Radio and Transmission Power Selection for Internet of Things" (IWQoS'17) and
"Robust Optimal Selection of Radio Type and Transmission Power for Internet of Things" (TOSN'19).

## Empirical Study Data
1. Power consumption traces measured when WiFi, ZigBee, and BLE radios transmit at each transmission power;
2. Packet reception ratio (PRR) recorded when WiFi, ZigBee, and BLE radios transmit at different distances to the receiver with fixed transmission powers.

## Evaluation Data
1. General Experiments: power traces and packet transmission/reception records under the approaches disccuesed in the papers;
2. Indoor and Outdoor Experiments: power consumption and packet transmission/reception records in the location-specific experiments;
3. Channel Interference Experiments: power consumption and packet transmission/reception records in the experiments with controlled interference;
4. TDMA-based Experiments: packet reception ratio and power consumption recoreded when multiple nodes join the network under the TDMA-based MAC protocol.
